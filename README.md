# SPMLS
SPMLS-Scalable Processing of Mobile Laser Scanning data. This is an open source library written in C/C++ for point cloud processing, particularly for mobile laser scanning point clouds data sets.

This library is part of my PhD research, which consists of a series of scalable processing modules in C/C++, i.e. scalable filtering, segmentation, outliers removal, cloud intersection and object recognition. All those modules are encapsulated as standard C++ libraries.
